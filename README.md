# CTR-Prediction-with-Stochastic-Gradient-Descent

## Why do this?
The goal of this project is to predict whether a dataset of advertisements will be clicked. In solving this problem, I use a stochastic gradient descent algorithm called Pegasos, which is commonly used for [click-through rate (CTR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Click-through_rate#:~:text=Click%2Dthrough%20rate%20(CTR)) prediction.

## 1. Dataset Description
### Data Source:
The data is sourced from [CriteoLabs](https://labs.criteo.com/), a multinational corporation in the digital marketing industry, specializing in algorithmic approaches to determine what to show users. In an [old kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/criteo-display-ad-challenge), 7 days worth of Criteo's ad data was released. From here on out, this will be referred to as "the Criteo data" in this notebook and it's contained in the  'train_subsampled' file. 

### Data Fields

- Label - Target variable that indicates if an ad was clicked (1) or not (0).
- I1-I13 - A total of 13 columns of integer features (mostly count features).
- C1-C26 - A total of 26 columns of categorical features. The values of these features have been hashed onto 32 bits for anonymization purposes.  

The semantics of the features remain undisclosed.  
  When a value is missing, the field is empty.
